    <h1>Recommendations</h1>
    <p>From the places I have visited the ones that I recommend the most are London, Cartagena, and Dubai; each of these places are magical and have lots of places to go to shop, walk, sightsee and eat delicious food. Talking about food, my favorite places to go to eat are Romero which has delicious pasta, pizza, steak, and desserts, Crepes and Waffles has as well tasty and variated food, Mundos has the best meat and drinks and all restaurants have a great location and rural decoration. Lastly, I recommend a book called Atomic Habits which has many good advices to improve yourself, build healthy habits and leave bad ones. </p>
